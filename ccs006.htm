 <p>
 This example uses the background-image,
 background-position and background-attachment
 styles to place the <span class = "dark">OnRoad</span> logo in the bottom,
 right corner of the page. Notice how the logo
 stays in the proper position when you resize the
 browser window. The background-color fills in where
 there is no image.

 <div style = "width: 20%">Here is some
 
 text that goes in a box which is
19 set to stretch across twenty percent
20 of the width of the screen.</div>

 <div style = "width: 80%; text-align: center">
 Here is some CENTERED text that goes in a box
 which is set to stretch across eighty percent of
 the width of the screen.</div>

 <hr/>
 
 
 <div style = "width: 20%; height: 150px; overflow: scroll">
 This box is only twenty percent of
 the width and has a fixed height.
 What do we do if it overflows? Set the
 overflow property to scroll!</div>
